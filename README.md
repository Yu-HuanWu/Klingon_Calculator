# [Klingon Calculator](https://yu-huanwu.github.io/Klingon_Calculator/)

## Background

_qavan_! 

This is a calculator that uses Klingon numberals. This app works because Klingon just
happens to use a base 10 number system, which is familiar to most Earthlings. Which number
is 4? Which one is 7? You will figure it out in no time _jup_!

### "_pagh bIngDaq_" (Negative)

Negative number can be expressed as _pagh bIngDaq mI’_ [number] below zero. Examples: _pagh bIngDaq cha’_ -2; _pagh bingDaq wejvatlh wej_ -33. Although this may 
or may not be canon as the proper term has not been define by Marc Okrand yet.

### "_vI’_" (Decimal point)

There are few different ways to express decimal points, such as "_ratlh_", which means
"remain" or "remainder" (for example: _chen wa’ loS; ratlh cha’_, 14 with remainder 2), or 
_qaSqa'taHbogh_, which means "continues to happen again" (for example: _chen wej wej vI’ wej qaSqa'taHbogh_, 33.3 recurring in the case of 100/3). The creator of this app decided to
use _vI'_ for its broader utility.

### "_Qagh_" (Error)

Although it looks sort of like English letter S,E, and I, it is actually Klingon
alphabet for Q, a, and gh, which when put together means "error".
